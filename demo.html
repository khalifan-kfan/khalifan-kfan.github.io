       A new user could see the screening movie but without loging in or signing up, they will  no be able to 
       access their screening schedules to buy a ticket. This prompted us to have a user authentication Api
       intergreted into the application and went with google firebase for its flexibility. The only information required
       from the user is there email password and phone number in order to proceed and get the best experince.

       We scouted cinemas around kampala and found out that the seat numbering system is almost similer across all.
       Therefore since we haven't gotten official permission to access any cinema's schedule yet, we created a test movies schedule
       in firestore(a collection-based database) from the firebase API to successfully carry out test which proved quite
       helpfull since the database is already remotely hosted.

        The video by the side demonstrates a use case of a logged in user who has all tabs unlocked (the Dashboard and history tab).
        They should be then able to see all the screening days of the movie since movie charges are determined according to which
        day of the week it is, futher more, when a day is picked then they should be prompted to pick a cinema hall, look through the 
        various times that movie will screen that day,see the available seats per time and then procceed to a screen where they should 
        chose a seat or seats.
        The seats interface has automatic calculation system base on the number of seats chosen and the days price and after the user 
        should procceed to to the payment screen which is the last step in processing their ticket.
        For payment we used the MTN MOMO open API, though in the demonstration its the test version of the ARI still under use.
        The payment screen prompts a user for their active number to be used for payment and once they confirm to pay they should receive
        a confirmation pin entry request and when they do the app should pick it up in the background and their ticket should be generated
        so the user can access it on their Dashboard.

        The Dashboard will contain unused tickets which could either be still not yet screened(active) or already screened
        but the user missed the date(expired). The use button will only be active on the active tickets other wise it will be invisible
        and when it is not visible all a user can do is cancel the ticket and have it sent to history for now.
        The "use" button being visible means the ticket is still active and the button should be pushed (by or around a cinema agent) 
        with evidence that the user is entering the cinema hall (at the door), and at that instant the ticket is pushed to history so it cant be used twice.

       The information kept on the ticket is comprised of; 
       <ul>
        <li>Details about the movie like the title or thumbnail.</li>
        <li>If it will be in a 3D cinema or 2D, and whether the sound is Dolby or not.</li>
        <li>The email of the user who has bought it</li>
        <li>The cinema hall name and exact date and time the movie will screen.</li>
        <li>The number of seats bought and the seat number(s) the user booked 
        </li>
        <li>Whether the ticket is active or expired.</li>
        <li>The total amount charged for the seats.

       Moving on, the video on the side demonstrates a use case of someone logged out or 
       new to the application and it clearly shows they
       can not procceed with out signing up or in, the rest of the procedure is the same.
      Again this helps establish ticket ownership and alittle bit of authentication.
      The history tab should include the used and expired tickets, there the use can track their
      previous interactions with the booking system.
      This application is quite automatic in that there is no middle man, movie schedule database is updated
      frequently and all the user should do is pay for a seat when ever they see a movie the want.
      Point to note; The videos show use of an mtn momo test api so any number used returns successfull transactions
      since we are using a test environment.

        Point to note: If you have realised, half of the the problems have been pinned down already most especially the 
        issue of following covid 19 SOPs for the reopening of cinema halls, no long queues for tickets, no physical handling of tickets,
        no physical handling of money and the seats available can be spaced appropriatly leaving making blank seats
        between two seats unavailable.
        It will be good for the community.
